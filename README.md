    You don't have to mine nonstop on a block to finish it off. You can pause, and come back later.
</p>

You don't have to point nonstop on a Block, never letting go of the mouse button, to finish it off. You can pause, walk away, mine another Block ... whatever you want.

Works with multiple players too, so you can mine the same block together and get speed! (The more players, the more speed)

This mod is entirely server-side. Clients do not need it to play on a server. This also works on single player
